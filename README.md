#Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
## Purpose:
I learned a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went  through the task myself. I then looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of your hypotheses.

## How to use:
The project has 4 files:
* Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon.html: Final Report
* Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon.csv: The project dataset.
* Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenons.md: The project instructions.
